# Day 2: Openings

`r newthought("On Day 1, we focused on mechanics")` rather than content. Today,
we'll talk about content, focusing on your Introduction. I usually find this
section the hardest to write, and I'll often put it off until last. You need to
draw in your reader and convince him or her that the rest of the paper is worth
reading (and, for a research article, that the science was worth doing). If a
reviewer is going to hate your paper, he or she often decides by the end of the
Introduction (based on review comments I've gotten for past papers). And while
the other reviewers won't decide that they love it by that point, they can be
convinced that they are in reasonably good hands, and that you are competent in
the area and familiar with the field and open problems in it.

*Writing Science* discusses the job of an Introduction in a
scientific paper, and how an Introduction can fail. For today's meeting, you'll 
be reading through several chapters in this book, evaluating whether and how the
Introductions in the three example papers do their job, thinking about how to frame
the Introduction for your manuscript. 

1. **Summarize your manuscript.**

In 2--3 sentences, describe what your manuscript covers. 

In 2--3 more sentences, explain why your manuscript is important in advancing
science in your field.

2. **Read Chapters ...**

3. 

4. **Read Chapters ...**

5. **Identify the ... in the example papers.**

Re-read the Introductions of each of the three example papers. Write down the ...
for each of the papers. 

For each of the papers, is this ... clearly written, or did you extrapolate it from
other parts of the Introduction and/or your own knowledge on the topic? If is was
clearly stated, highlight the sentence(s).


**All the following steps are things for you to try after our workshop 
meeting on "Openings".**
