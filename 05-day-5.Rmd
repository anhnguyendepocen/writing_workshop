# Day 5: Words

`r newthought("We'll wrap up by talking about")` editing you can do at the level
of words. I find this to be the easiest and most fun type of editing. A lot of
it doesn't take a lot of mental work, but your writing immediately feels much
lighter! 

A lot of the advice in this section will have a secondary benefit---it will 
reduce the number of words it takes you to say something. In scientific writing, 
we often have to fit our final work within a constrained word count or page limit. 
Since we want to have high-impact, high-content papers, this can be a big 
struggle. The suggestions today will help with this. 

The other key point for today is how word choices can make your writing
easier to read and understand. There are two key angles here. First, you want
to identify the "terms of art" in your paper. What are the technical terms
that mean something very specific, and that you can't simplify without losing
important subtlety? For these words, you must make sure that (1) you're using
the right term for your field and (2) you consistently use the same term for that
idea. Second, you have all the other words in your paper, the ones that aren't 
terms of art. Scientific reading is hard enough just because of the scientific
content. Therefore, I feel strongly that you should try to make all these other
words---the ones that aren't terms of art---as simple as possible. Therefore, 
part of the editing process at the word level will be to simplify any vocabulary
that doesn't absolutely have to be more complex. 

The techniques we'll cover today are outlines in several of the books---*Style* has
a chapter on "Concision" that we'll cover, and *Writing Science in Plain English* and
*Writing Science* both have helpful chapters. 

1.  **Read Chapter 7 from *Style* (same chapter in the second edition) and Chapter 6 from *Writing Science in Plain English.**

These two chapters cover how to remove needless words from your writing. Both cover
several ways that words can be redundant.

2. **Diagnose and fix word redundance in paragraphs from example papers.**

On an earlier day, we looked closesly at the following paragraph from the Schwartz
paper: 

> "The question of disease etiology is complex. It is likely that a multitude of
causes is involved in the development of any particular disease. Where in the
causal chain, among the myriad of variables, one chooses to examine and
ascertain causation is often a question of where intervention is most
efficacious. That, in turn, is often a political and not a scientific issue. An
examination of the full range of variables potentially involved in disease
etiology, with a synthesis of findings from all levels of analysis, provides the
best opportunity for a full understanding of disease etiology."

Based on what you just read, identify words in this text that might be redundant. 
Try re-writing the text to remove those redundant words. You can either keep the
same structure for the paragraph otherwise, or you can start from the re-written
version of this paragraph you created on an earlier day.

Do the same exercise with the following paragraph from the Cheplygina et al. paper:

> "But even more importantly, Twitter culture has exposed a part of academia
that has traditionally always been hidden from view, namely the inception of new
research activities. Now, ECRs can observe and even join the process of creating
national or international research projects (for instance, [6] stems from a
discussion at Twitter and Bik et al [1] write their work resulted from online
interactions). Senior researchers openly share ideas through Twitter and this
can lead to the development of new concepts which often move on to become
fully-fledged research projects."

3. **Diagnose and fix redundant words in your manuscript.**

Pick a string of three or four paragraphs in your manuscript. Go carefully through
each type of redundancy described in the reading from prompt 1. Identify any 
cases in your paragraphs and fix them. 

For some of these, you can use the "Search" tool to search for potentially redundant
words. For example, you can do a search for meaningless words like "actually", 
"really", and "various". To look for doubled words, it might be helpful to do a 
search for "and". If you're struggling with some of the other types of redundancies, 
you might want to look through some of the many online lists with examples,
