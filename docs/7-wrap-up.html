<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> Wrap-up</h1>
<p><span class="newthought">If you’re doing it right,</span> you will continue working to improve your
writing your whole career. We can only cover a bit in one week. Here are some tips for
things to do to continue:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Read a lot.</strong> Ultimately, you will have to read a lot of journal articles in your
field to internalize the style of your field. By “style” here, I mean things like
what the Introduction normally covers (and in what depth), how limitations of the
study are discussed, how much detail should be included in the Methods, and how
materials are split between the main text and the Supplemental Online Material for
manuscripts. As a student, you will need to read a lot anyway to become familiar with
the literature. In later stages of your career, you will read a lot (of varying quality)
through service roles, like as a peer reviewer. At all stages, you will learn more about
what works and what doesn’t, what’s expected and what isn’t, in your field if you read
a lot of journal articles in that field.</li>
<li><strong>Find some favorite authors.</strong>
For environmental epidemiology, one of my favorite authors is Ben Armstrong. He can
explain very complex methodological approaches very clearly. For R programming, I love
reading things that have been written by Jenny Bryan and Richie Cotton.</li>
<li><strong>Work on grammar and usage or find a good copyeditor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Try out writing groups and sessions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explore brainstorming, planning, and organizing tools for writing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn LaTeX.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Find your favorite text editor and learn to use it well.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn more about rhetoric.</strong></li>
</ol>
