<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Books for the workshop</h2>
<p>We will be reading and trying out the ideas from several books for this
workshop. They all have connections to Joseph Williams <em>Style</em> book, which has
gone through several editions (and titles) since it was first published in the
1980s.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good writing books out there, but this is by far my favorite.
I regularly pick it back up when I am editing manuscripts, particularly when I have
a section of a draft that I am struggling to write clearly. What I like about it
is that it focuses on how we can edit our writing to make it easier for readers
to read and understand. It bases its advice on how readers process information as
they read, and it gives advice that is easy to use to diagnose problems and
fix them.</p>
<p>I cannot overstate how important it is to edit your scientific manuscript until
it can be read easily (and feel “quick” to read) and until it is hard to
misunderstand. You are moving into work where you will be the expert in the
room. You will know your very specific topic better than all but a handful of
people in the world, and often better than the editor and reviewers
for your manuscript. You are teaching through your manuscript, and the text
must be clear for readers to learn what you’ve learned.</p>
<p>Also, scientific papers are hard work to read, even when they are written
beautifully. As the reader, you must work to understand the science and
statistical methods that were used to generate results for the paper. Your mind
works hard to integrate the paper’s results with what you know from other papers
in the field. If the writer does not make the writing clear and easy to read, it
can feel impossible to read the paper, because your brain can’t simultaneously
try to figure out what the writer was trying to say and what the science in the
paper is saying. You have worked hard on your science. It’s worth the effort to
edit your manuscript until you remove all overhead you can that makes the
writing hard to read. Most people, even senior scientists, write first drafts
that are a drag to read. Even if all the information is there, it’s a lot of
work to mentally extract it, and it’s often hard to follow along with the
arguments and explanations. It’s fine for your early drafts to be like that.
It’s not good for the submitted manuscript to still feel so heavy.</p>
<p>The examples in <em>Style</em> are mainly from academic non-fiction, although not
specifically from scientific manuscripts or manuscripts meant for peer review.
Fortunately, two other writers have taken Williams’s ideas and illustrated
how they work in scientific writing. Further, they give some tips specific to
scientific writing, including how to plan and structure certain sections—like the
Introduction and Discussion.</p>
<p>The final book includes a section on arguments. We often don’t think of
scientific writing as argumentative, but it really is. You will need to convince
readers that your study is important, that it advances the science. Then you’ll
need to not just present your results, but provide an interpretation for those
results. You will need to walk your readers through why those interpretations
are reasonable and appropriate. While many students come into graduate school
with a reasonable mastery of grammar, they often present their arguments in a
way that is scattered and diffuse. Often, when I am editing manuscripts with
first authors who are students, much of the editing process is related to
finding and fleshing out their arguments. We won’t be able to go deeply into
rhetoric in this workshop, but we will cover the basics of building arguments
in your writing based on the advice in this book.</p>
