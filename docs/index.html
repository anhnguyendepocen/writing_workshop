<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p><span class="newthought">Welcome to our one-week</span> writing workshop! This workshop is
meant for students who are working on a manuscript that they plan to submit for
peer review at a scientific journal. We’ll be focusing on how to structure and
rewrite your manuscript to make it clearer and easier to read.</p>
<p>There are a number of things that are important that we won’t cover here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Grammar and usage.</strong> These are both very important, and you’ll want these
to be impeccable when you submit your manuscript. However, there are loads of
resources and courses for this, and while I often see cases where students
haven’t mastered this yet, I don’t think it’s hard to find the resources to
learn these. Also, at least through your graduate career, you will almost always
have co-authors, including a senior author (typically the head of your research
group). Grammar and usage problems are easy to fix quickly when your senior author
edits your paper. The things we will cover here take more time and work.</li>
<li><strong>Doing a literature review.</strong> This is an art of its own. It’s very important
for your manuscript to use good examples from the literature to set up why your
study is important and to put what you find in the context of previously
published studies. If you are pursuing a graduate degree, you will need to
explore the literature enough to understand the current state of science in your
field and how your work fits into the field. With certain types of manuscripts,
like commentaries and reviews, the whole manuscript might be a synthesis and
exploration of the literature. Ideally, you will have done quite a bit of
work to explore and get examples from the literature by the time we do this
workshop, as this will provide some of the raw material for your manuscript.
However, we will only tangentially discuss how to explore and review the literature.
This will be in the context of building and presenting arguments in your manuscript,
as evidence from the literature will often be needed to do this, particularly in the
Introduction and Discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Creating effective figures and tables.</strong> This is also extremely important.
At worst, bad figures and tables can make a manuscript look unprofessional. If
they do, then a reviewer may worry that the research presented in the study is
similarly sloppy or poorly done. Figures and tables are the best chance to immediately
engage a reader, and they’ll often stick with the reader, if they’re good, much
longer than the text. They also served double-duty, as you’ll often also include
them in presentations you make about the research. Finally, a really good figure or
table encourages the reader to explore the results from the research deeply, and
start looking for patterns or trends that suggest ideas for next steps for the
research area. Manuscripts are more likely to get cited, and to have a higher
impact on your field, if readers leave the paper with ideas of research they want
to do to take the next steps. There are some excellent resources for learning how
to design and create figures and tables. I particularly like books by Edward Tufte
and Howard Wainer. There are also a number of books on visualization that are
specific to a programming language, like R or Python.</li>
<li><strong>How to get words on paper.</strong> Our focus will be strongly on improving and
revising a manuscript once you’ve already got some stuff down on paper. We won’t
talk much about how to get some stuff down in the first place. There are some
good books on the topic of writing initial drafts. Different writers have
different styles for this. Some will work very hard on the first draft, so that
rewriting doesn’t need to be extensive. I tend to start by writing a lot, but
all of it pretty messy and drafty, and then wrangling and editing that raw
material into a more solid draft. I usually do lots of rounds of drafts,
starting with editing to move big parts around and form the larger structure of
the paper and to see where there are holes that need more evidence or support.
Then, in later drafts, my editing process involves drilling down to make
the writing clearer and easier to read. In this workshop we’ll focus on the work
involved with the later stages of editing. If you’d like to learn more about
tips and techniques for earlier stages, where the focus is generating your
starting material, I like the books of Peter Elbow. Stephen King’s <em>On Writing</em>
is also great, particularly in inspiring you to get something down even when
you’re discouraged (by bad reviews or by how big the task seems, for example).</li>
